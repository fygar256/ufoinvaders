UFOINVADER (ufoinvader.py)

Let's port old PC games to modern computers, Games in the attic, part 5

This is a game where you shoot down enemies invading from above with artillery shells and prevent them from reaching the bottom line of the screen. If you kill 65 enemies, the mission is cleared, and if they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

The original was a game on Commodore's CBM3032 42 years ago, and I've forgotten the official name, but I don't think there was a limit to how many enemies you had to kill to finish. I think it was a game from the doujinshi CURSOR. My memory is hazy, so I can't remember.

The key operations are 'space' to fire, '4' to move the cannon left, and '6' to move the cannon right. 'q' to quit the game.

It's a very simple game. The number of enemies you've killed will be displayed, so compete for the highest score.
